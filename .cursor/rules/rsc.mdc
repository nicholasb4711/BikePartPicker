# Your rule content

- Use @apps/shop/app/[country]/[language]/(default)/page.tsx as a good example of how we want to structure react server components
- Flat structure - not too much nesting
- Don't use state or effect unless absolutely needed
- Break down into easily parseable chunks 
- Want to be able to see the UI, read the component and easily map UI sections to code within the page
